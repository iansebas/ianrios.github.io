							<h2>Beclosr Terms of Service</h2>
							<h3>1. Terms</h3>

If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing Beclosr. The materials contained in Beclosr are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.</p>
							<h3>2. Use License</h3>
							<ol type="a">
							   <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of Beclosr per device for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
							   <ol type="i">
							       <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
							       <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
							       <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in Beclosr;</li>
							       <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
							       <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
							   </ol>
							    </li>
							   <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Beclosr at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</li>
							</ol>
							<h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>
							<ol type="a">
							   <li>The materials within Beclosr are provided on an 'as is' basis.

							</ol>
							<h3>4. Limitations</h3>
							<p>In no event shall Beclosr or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use Beclosr, even if Beclosr or a Beclosr authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
